This is an extension for Google Slides allowing to add a configurable progress bar at the top or the bottom of the slides, and page numbers at any of the corners of the slides.

It is an extension of the [Progress bar add-on for Google Slides project](https://github.com/gsuitedevs/apps-script-samples/tree/master/slides/progress), explained in the [Quickstart section of the G Suite team](https://github.com/gsuitedevs/apps-script-samples/tree/master/slides/progress). It allows end users to customize the progress bar through a UI, and also adding page numbers in any of the 4 corners of the slides.
